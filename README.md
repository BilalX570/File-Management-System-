# ðŸ“‚  File Management System

A robust and efficient file management system implemented in C++ that provides essential file operations for organizing and manipulating files in a filesystem.

A high-performance, cross-platform file management system built with modern C++ that provides enterprise-grade file operations with an extensible architecture.


## Features

- Create, delete, rename files and directories
- Copy and move files between directories
- Search for files by name or extension
- View file metadata (size, creation date, permissions)
- Basic text file editing capabilities
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/macOS)
